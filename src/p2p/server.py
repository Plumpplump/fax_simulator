"""The listening half of the toolkit: :class:`PeerServer`.

A ``PeerServer`` accepts TCP connections and, for each one, reads framed
:class:`~p2p.message.Message` objects in a loop. Every message is handed to the
``on_message`` callback you supply. That callback can be a normal function *or*
an ``async def`` - the server awaits it either way, so handlers are free to do
their own ``await`` work (like updating a UI).

The server knows nothing about *what* the messages mean. That is the caller's
job, which is exactly what makes this reusable across projects.
